 In selection sort, the smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to its appropriate position into the array. It is also the simplest algorithm. 
It is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, first is sorted part, and another one is the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part of the array is empty, and unsorted part is the given array.
Sorted part is placed at the left, while the unsorted part is placed at the right.

// C++ program for implementation of
// selection sort
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void selectionSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, j, min_idx;
	for (i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
		min_idx = i;
		for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
			if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
				min_idx = j;
		}
		if (min_idx != i)
			swap(arr[min_idx], arr[i]);
	}
}
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
		cout << endl;
	}
}
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 64, 25, 12, 22, 11 };
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

	// Function Call
	selectionSort(arr, n);
	cout << "Sorted array: \n";
	printArray(arr, n);
	return 0;
}
